        THE STORY

Headbetter Salon in Sherman Oaks is the only salon in the world that is equipped with a fashion photography studio in-house and offers a full makeover with a professional photoshoot all in one package along with your hairstyle.

Headbetter is not just a salon, it’s an agency of sorts, a collective of creative artists that offers world class service in their respective specialties. We have Hairdressers of course, make up artists, photographers, videographers and digital editors on call to serve you in creating the masterpiece photoshoot that is your special day, your Supermodel Makeover.

You might be thinking… “this sounds too good to be true… how did you guys come up with this?”

Well, the short answer is competitiveness. When Headbetter salon owner Johnny Ciccone first started the business, he quickly realized how important  digital imagery was to maintain relevance in our social media driven business. He sized up the competition and realized that if he really wanted to beat the competition, he had to step up his photography game. the trusty Iphone was just not going to cut it. he bought a dslr camera and set his sights on mastering photography. The rest is history.

Over 100  models later, Headbetter has broken ground, we have an edge over other salons, because we produce professional grade photography in house at the salon. We have an edge over photographers, because the key ingredient to any good portrait is YOU the model… and who knows how to beautify a client better than your hairdresser?

Our hair and make up artists are world class, you won’t find better anywhere, and when we marry Our beauty skills with artistic, client driven fashion and editorial photography… , and focus the lens on YOU… you receive the ultimate experience. Everything you expect from a professional fashion photoshoot, signed, sealed and delivered same day as your hair and make up service.

I have one actress client who recently hit it big in a huge box office feature film, she had been paying over $800 for headshots, but using our photoshoot pictures for everything… she became a client after responding to one of our first casing calls, she had been spending big money on photographers year after year when she told me… “Johnny, it’s your pictures that I use on my IMDB, and social media… why don’t you charge people for this… you do such good hair and take such good pictures… they are so much more fun than all these boring headshots everyone is paying for”

After she told me that, I knew I had a product that was great for Actors Actresses, and everyone else as well, who doesn’t want a great picture of the best hairday of their life!

People come in and spend a small fortune on their hair, Balayage, Haircut, style… with tickets ranging upwards of $400 for a full service day at the salon, why not take home the souvenir that will last a lifetime? The obligatory selfie was just not going to cut it… CUE MAKE UP… Johnnies long history of doing hair for film and television introduced him to the best make up artists in the world… so why not have one of them really take that selfie to the next level? and then… since we have come this far…  lets get out some professional beauty lights and get the flash bulbs popping!

Haircolor fades… that amazing cut will will grow out in a couple months… and make up… it’s a one day treat… So now, here you are, looking better than you ever have in your life, and you get to sit with a professional photographer who has one goal in mind, capture you in the best light that ever shined on you, in your favorite outfit… in the most glamorous moment of your life. YOU ARE A MODEL, as good as any model that ever lived, Headbetter sees you that way. that way and YOU DESERVE IT!!! Real people, real Hollywood treatment. We think everybody deserves to feel like a model at Headbetter Salon… Its the greatest gift we could ever give you, and we love doing it!
